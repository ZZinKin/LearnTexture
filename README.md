# What's this repo for?

LearnTexture contains demos for [Texture](http://texturegroup.org/docs/layout2-quickstart.html) which is known as ASDK.

Texture's repo has many demos, but I think they are to tricky to use, you have to switch to the directory and type `pod install` at cmd, and those demos are not well-orginized and confusing.

# Goal

I am writing a better demo project for people learning Texture. Texture is a great project and maybe the future of writing iOS user interfaces.

For this goal, I will:

- Synthesis all the basic nodes and test most of the api interactively.
- Seperately display how each layout type works, then combine them and make them adjustable by using scrollbar.
- Provide a mimic of an actural app.
